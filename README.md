# Airbus-Flight-Challenge
Analyzed factors influencing propeller efficiency, such as blade geometry and orientation, and developed a MATLAB program to optimize and compare energy functions for different blade configurations for a 3-bladed propeller. Proposed and demonstrated a novel energy regeneration idea using morphing blades.
