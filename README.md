# Airbus-Flight-Challenge
1. Analyzed factors influencing propeller efficiency, such as blade geometry and orientation, and developed a MATLAB program
to optimize and compare energy functions for different blade configurations for a 3-bladed propeller
2. Proposed and demonstrated a novel energy regeneration idea using morphing blades, achieving up to 7% power savings
per flight leg compared to conventional propellers
